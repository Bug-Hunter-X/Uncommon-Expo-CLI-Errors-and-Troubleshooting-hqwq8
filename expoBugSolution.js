To solve this, you'll need a systematic approach: 

1. **Clear the Expo cache:** `expo start --clear`
2. **Check package versions:** Ensure all your packages (especially React Native and Expo modules) are compatible. Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to inspect your dependency tree and identify conflicting versions. Check the Expo documentation for compatibility guidelines.
3. **Review project configuration:** Carefully examine `package.json`, `app.json`, and `eas.json`.  Ensure these files are correctly configured according to the Expo documentation and your project's requirements. Common issues include incorrect module names or missing dependencies.
4. **Upgrade Expo CLI:**  If using an older version, update your Expo CLI to the latest version: `npm install -g expo-cli`
5. **Create a new project:** In some cases, a completely new Expo project might be required. This is a way of eliminating problems related to corrupted project configuration.
6. **Check your SDK version:** Make sure your project's `app.json` file specifies a compatible SDK version.  Out-of-date SDK versions can lead to unpredictable behavior.
7. **Inspect logs:** Look for detailed error messages in your terminal or logs. These messages might provide more specific clues about the root of the issue.
