This repository demonstrates troubleshooting uncommon errors encountered when using the Expo CLI.  The `expoBug.js` file showcases a project with a potential problem (e.g., conflicting dependencies or incorrect setup), while `expoBugSolution.js` provides the corrected code and steps to resolve the issue.  Common causes include dependency version conflicts, cache issues, and incorrect configurations.  Solutions often involve cleaning the cache, verifying dependency versions using `npm ls` or `yarn why`, and carefully checking project files like `package.json`, `app.json`, and `eas.json` for correctness.
